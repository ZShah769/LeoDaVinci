                    <ul class="maintext">
                        <li>Leonardo Davinci was born in <time datetime="1452">1452</time> - <time datetime="1519">1519</time> in Anchiano, Tuscany, which is part of modern Italy.</li>
                        <li>His father was a man of high status, while his mother was a peasant. 
                            This resulted in his father not being around that much for his upbringing, although his uncle helped raise him and passed his apprecation of nature onto him.</li>
                        <li>At the age of 15 his father akcnowleged his artistic talent and brought him to the sculptor and painter Andrea del Verrocchio. He became an independant artistic master by the age of 26.</li>
                        <li>Leonardo moved to Milan to work for the ruling Sforza clan around the age of 30 as their engineer, painter, architect, desginer, and sculptor.
                            A bronze equestrain statue 16 foot in height was the Sforza clan asked him to build in honor of the clan’s founder. It was never completed due to the bronze needed for a conflict when the Sforza duke lost his position.

                    <h2 class="contenttitle1">Most Famous Paintings</h2>
                    <ul class="maintext">
                        <li>Even though much of Da Vinci’s patings haven’t survived, partly because he did not have that many paintings, he had two that became one of the world’s most famous paintings.
                        </li>
                        <li>“The Last Supper” was created between the years of <time datetime="1495">1495</time> - <time datetime="1498">1498</time> in Milan.</li>
                        <li> It represents the dinner Jesus had with his apostles where he stated that one them would betray him.
                            This paintings most notable feature is that all of the apostles have their own unique body and facial expressions. He created it for the dining hall in the Monastery of Santa Maria delle Grazie.

                        <li>The painting of this mysterious woman had people coming up with theories about who she was.
                            It was originally thought that she was Mona Lisa Gherardini, a courtesan, but current academics believe that she was the wife of a merchant from Florentine named Fransisco del Giocondo. This painting is currently in Paris, France, in the Louvre Museum.

                    <h2 class="contenttitle1">Philosophy of Interconnectedness</h2>
                    <ul class="maintext">
                        <li>Leonardo Da Vinci did not only study the areas stated previously, but also nature, mechanics, anatomy, physics, artichtecture, and weaponry. He was a man ahead of his time, coming up with designs for the military tanks, submarine, bicycle, and helicopter.
                        </li>
                        <li>He believed that the ability to see is a person’s greatest sense, and “knowing how to see” was important to make the most of life.
                            He did not see art and science as two different disciplines, but as connected disciplines that complimented each other.
                            
                            </li>
                        <li>Because of his broad range of interests, he never completed a notable amount of paintings. He would spend his time also in nature, trying to come up with scientific laws, dissecting living organisms, and jotting down his thoughts. Later on, his main interests would become human anatomy, mechanics, painting, and architecture.
                        </li>
                        <li>Davinci would leave behind documents that are currently in various museum’s due to them being disperesed after his death. They would contain intresting
                            inventions, such as a mechanical bat with a height of 65 feet, or studies of the human body.
                            </li>

                    <h2 class="contenttitle1">Late Years</h2>
                    <ul class="maintext">
                        <li>In <time datetime="1516">1516</time>, Da Vinci left Italy to become the French ruler’s Premier Painter and Engineer and Architect to the King.</li>
                        <li>He took residency in a country manor house, while drawing and painting whenever he wanted to.
                            There are bitter tones in his sketches which may imply that his time there wasn’t necessarily good, and he eventually died at the age of 67 in <time datetime="1519">1519</time>, at the Cloux.</li>
                        <li>He was buried in the church of Saint-Florentin, but a French Revolution
                            almost destroyed the church which makes it impossible to know where he was buried.</li>
